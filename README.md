# Sensitive Ant Algorithm for Edge Detection in Medical Images

Abstract

Nowadays, reliable medical diagnostics from computed tomography (CT) and X-rays can be obtained by using a large number of image edge detection methods. One technique with a high potential to improve the edge detection of images is ant colony optimization (ACO). In order to increase both the quality and the stability of image edge detection, a vector called pheromone sensitivity level, PSL, was used within ACO. Each ant in the algorithm has one assigned element from PSL, representing the ant’s sensibility to the artificial pheromone. A matrix of artificial pheromone with the edge information of the image is built during the process. Demi-contractions in terms of the mathematical admissible perturbation are also used in order to obtain feasible results. In order to enhance the edge results, post-processing with the DeNoise convolutional neural network (DnCNN) was performed. When compared with Canny edge detection and similar techniques, the sensitive ACO model was found to obtain overall better results for the tested medical images; it outperformed the Canny edge detector by 37.76%.

# Enhancing Ant-Based Algorithms for Medical Image Edge Detection by Admissible Perturbations of Demicontractive Mappings

Abstract

The aim of this paper is to show analytically and empirically how ant-based algorithms for medical image edge detection can be enhanced by using an admissible perturbation of demicontractive operators. We thus complement the results reported in a recent paper by the second author and her collaborators, where they used admissible perturbations of demicontractive mappings as test functions. To illustrate this fact, we first consider some typical properties of demicontractive mappings and of their admissible perturbations and then present some appropriate numerical tests to illustrate the improvement brought by the admissible perturbations of demicontractive mappings when they are taken as test functions in ant-based algorithms for medical image edge detection. The edge detection process reported in our study considers both symmetric (Head CT and Brain CT) and asymmetric (Hand X-ray) medical images. The performance of the algorithm was tested visually with various images and empirically with evaluation of parameters.

# Admissible Perturbation of Demicontractive Operators within Ant Algorithms for Medical Images Edge Detection

Abstract

Nowadays, demicontractive operators in terms of admissible perturbation are used to solve difficult tasks. The current research uses several demicontractive operators in order to enhance the quality of the edge detection results when using ant-based algorithms. Two new operators are introduced, χ -operator and KH -operator, the latter one is a Krasnoselskij admissible perturbation of a demicontractive operator. In order to test the efficiency of the new operators, a comparison is made with a trigonometric operator. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is the solver chosen for the images edge detection problem. Demicontractive operators in terms of admissible perturbation are used during the construction phase of the matrix of ants artificial pheromone, namely the edge information of an image. The conclusions of statistical analysis on the results shows a positive influence of proposed operators for image edge detection of medical images.
